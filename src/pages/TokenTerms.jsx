            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-2">1. Purpose and Use of FXCT</h2>
            <p>
              FXCT is a non-refundable, non-redeemable utility token intended solely for use within the FractionaX platform. FXCT grants no rights, express or implied, to any equity, dividends, voting power, or ownership in FractionaX or any affiliated entity.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-2">2. Subscription-Based Issuance & Locking Period</h2>
            <p>
              FXCT distributed through subscriptions is provided at a discounted rate and subject to a mandatory 45-day lock-up period. Users agree not to transfer, exchange, or sell these tokens during the lock period. This restriction is hardcoded in the smart contract to prevent manipulation and ensure sustainability.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-2">3. Transfer Fees & Smart Contract Behavior</h2>
            <p>
              Transfers of FXCT incur variable fees according to smart contract logic. Fees range from 1% of the transaction amount to a maximum of $12.00 USD. Fee caps vary by transaction size tier. FractionaX reserves the right to update smart contract parameters as needed for compliance or economic balancing. All fees are used to support operations, ecosystem development, and platform security.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-2">4. Acknowledgement of Risk</h2>
            <p>
              The purchase and use of FXCT involves risk. You acknowledge that token prices may be volatile and market conditions unpredictable. No assurance is made regarding liquidity, secondary market availability, or continued utility. You accept full responsibility for your use of FXCT and agree that FractionaX bears no liability for token loss, theft, or devaluation.
            </p>
          </div>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-2">5. No Refunds or Chargebacks</h2>
            <p>
              All FXCT purchases are final. You waive all rights to reversal, chargeback, or refund unless explicitly required by law. It is your responsibility to confirm wallet addresses and transaction details before submission.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-2">6. Regulatory Classification & Disclosures</h2>
            <p>
              FXCT is intended to be classified as a utility token under applicable U.S. laws and is not a security under the Securities Act of 1933. FractionaX complies with relevant FinCEN, CFTC, and SEC guidance, and will adjust operations as laws evolve, including under the 2025 U.S. Digital Asset Market Structure Bill. We make no warranties that FXCT will be treated as non-security in all jurisdictions.
