## 🚨 If Still Not Working

### **Cache Busting Solution:**
Your image might be cached as "not found" by social platforms.

1. **Rename the file temporarily:**
   - Copy og-image1.png to og-image2.png
   - Update meta tags to use og-image2.png
   - Test with new URL

2. **Or add cache-busting parameter:**
   - Update meta tags to: `og-image1.png?v=20251003`

### **Alternative Quick Test:**
Use your social test page: https://fractionax.io/social-test.html
- This has independent meta tags
- Should show if the issue is main page specific

## 🎯 Verification Checklist

- ✅ **Image loads:** https://fractionax.io/og-image1.png (VERIFIED)
- ✅ **Meta tags correct:** Title, description, image URL
- ✅ **Cloudflare rules:** Social media bots allowed
- ⏳ **Cache clearing:** Clear browser and test tools
- 🧪 **Platform testing:** Facebook, Twitter, Discord

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Facebook Debugger is most accurate** - if it works there, it works everywhere
2. **Discord shows cards immediately** - great for quick testing
3. **Twitter can cache for 7 days** - be patient or use different URL
4. **WhatsApp previews work well** - send link to yourself

## 🚀 Expected Timeline

- **Immediately:** Facebook Debugger should work
- **Within 5 minutes:** Discord/Slack should show cards
- **Within 1 hour:** Most platforms should display rich cards
- **Within 24 hours:** All caching issues resolved

Your technical setup is correct - this is likely just a caching/timing issue that should resolve with the testing steps above!
